## After Review

### Mode-Driven Post-Review Flow

After presenting findings and verdict (Stage 6), route the next steps by mode. Review and synthesis stay the same in every mode; only mutation and handoff behavior changes.

#### Step 1: Build the action sets

- **Clean review** means zero findings after suppression and pre-existing separation. Skip the fix/handoff phase when the review is clean.
- **Fixer queue:** final findings routed to `safe_auto -> review-fixer`.
- **Residual actionable queue:** unresolved `gated_auto` or `manual` findings whose final owner is `downstream-resolver`.
- **Report-only queue:** `advisory` findings and any outputs owned by `human` or `release`.
- **Never convert advisory-only outputs into fix work or todos.** Deployment notes, residual risks, and release-owned items stay in the report.

#### Step 2: Choose policy by mode

**Interactive mode**

- Apply `safe_auto -> review-fixer` findings automatically without asking. These are safe by definition.
- Ask a policy question **using the platform's blocking question tool** (`ask_user` in Copilot CLI) only when `gated_auto` or `manual` findings remain after safe fixes. Do not replace with a conversational open-ended question. Adapt the options to match what actually remains:

  **When `gated_auto` findings are present** (with or without `manual`):
  ```
  Safe fixes have been applied. What should I do with the remaining findings?
  1. Review and approve specific gated fixes (Recommended)
  2. Leave as residual work
  3. Report only -- no further action
  ```

  **When only `manual` findings remain** (no `gated_auto`):
  ```
  Safe fixes have been applied. The remaining findings need manual resolution. What should I do?
  1. Leave as residual work (Recommended)
  2. Report only -- no further action
  ```

  If no blocking question tool is available, present the applicable numbered options as text and wait for the user's selection before proceeding.
- If no `gated_auto` or `manual` findings remain after safe fixes, skip the policy question entirely — report what was fixed and proceed to next steps.
- Only include `gated_auto` findings in the fixer queue after the user explicitly approves the specific items. Do not widen the queue based on severity alone.

**Autofix mode**

- Ask no questions.
- Apply only the `safe_auto -> review-fixer` queue.
- Leave `gated_auto`, `manual`, `human`, and `release` items unresolved.
- Prepare residual work only for unresolved actionable findings whose final owner is `downstream-resolver`.

**Report-only mode**

- Ask no questions.
- Do not build a fixer queue.
- Do not create residual todos or `.context` artifacts.
- Stop after Stage 6. Everything remains in the report.

**Headless mode**

- Ask no questions.
- Apply only the `safe_auto -> review-fixer` queue in a single pass. Do not enter the bounded re-review loop (Step 3). Spawn one fixer subagent, apply fixes, then proceed directly to Step 4.
- Leave `gated_auto`, `manual`, `human`, and `release` items unresolved — they appear in the structured text output.
- Output the headless output envelope (see Stage 6) instead of the interactive report.
- Write a run artifact (Step 4) but do not create todo files.
- Stop after the structured text output and "Review complete" signal. No commit/push/PR.

#### Step 3: Apply fixes with one fixer and bounded rounds

- Spawn exactly one fixer subagent for the current fixer queue in the current checkout. That fixer applies all approved changes and runs the relevant targeted tests in one pass against a consistent tree.
- Do not fan out multiple fixers against the same checkout. Parallel fixers require isolated worktrees/branches and deliberate mergeback.
- Re-review only the changed scope after fixes land.
- Bound the loop with `max_rounds: 2`. If issues remain after the second round, stop and hand them off as residual work or report them as unresolved.
- If any applied finding has `requires_verification: true`, the round is incomplete until the targeted verification runs.
- Do not start a mutating review round concurrently with browser testing on the same checkout. Future orchestrators that want both must either run `mode:report-only` during the parallel phase or isolate the mutating review in its own checkout/worktree.

#### Step 4: Emit artifacts and downstream handoff

- In interactive, autofix, and headless modes, write a per-run artifact under `.context/compound-engineering/kb-review/<run-id>/` containing:
  - synthesized findings
  - applied fixes
  - residual actionable work
  - advisory-only outputs
- In autofix mode, create durable todo files only for unresolved actionable findings whose final owner is `downstream-resolver`. Load the `todo-create` skill for the canonical directory path, naming convention, YAML frontmatter structure, and template. Each todo should map the finding's severity to the todo priority (`P0`/`P1` -> `p1`, `P2` -> `p2`, `P3` -> `p3`) and set `status: ready` since these findings have already been triaged by synthesis.
- Do not create todos for `advisory` findings, `owner: human`, `owner: release`, or protected-artifact cleanup suggestions.
- If only advisory outputs remain, create no todos.
- Interactive mode may offer to externalize residual actionable work after fixes, but it is not required to finish the review.

#### Step 5: Final next steps

**Interactive mode only:** after the fix-review cycle completes (clean verdict or the user chose to stop), offer next steps based on the entry mode. Reuse the resolved review base/default branch from Stage 1 when known; do not hard-code only `main`/`master`.

- **PR mode (entered via PR number/URL):**
  - **Push fixes** -- push commits to the existing PR branch
  - **Exit** -- done for now
- **Branch mode (feature branch with no PR, and not the resolved review base/default branch):**
  - **Create a PR (Recommended)** -- push and open a pull request
  - **Continue without PR** -- stay on the branch
  - **Exit** -- done for now
- **On the resolved review base/default branch:**
  - **Continue** -- proceed with next steps
  - **Exit** -- done for now

If "Create a PR": first publish the branch with `git push --set-upstream origin HEAD`, then use `gh pr create` with a title and summary derived from the branch changes.
If "Push fixes": push the branch with `git push` to update the existing PR.

**Autofix, report-only, and headless modes:** stop after the report, artifact emission, and residual-work handoff. Do not commit, push, or create a PR.
